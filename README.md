# WEB103 Project 3 - *CodePath Grader Conf*

Submitted by: **Quinn Redwoods**

About this web app: **A conference app for the fictional "CodePath Grader Conf" — browse rooms, view scheduled talks, and filter events by location or day. Features a visual SVG map for selecting venues and live countdown timers for upcoming events.**

Time spent: **5** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT * FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**
- [x] **The web app displays a title.**
- [x] **Website includes a visual interface that allows users to select a location they would like to view.**
  - [x] *Note: A non-visual list of links to different locations is insufficient.*
- [x] **Each location has a detail page with its own unique URL.**
- [x] **Clicking on a location navigates to its corresponding detail page and displays list of all events from the `events` table associated with that location.**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] An additional page shows all possible events
  - [x] Users can sort *or* filter events by location.
- [x] Events display a countdown showing the time remaining before that event
  - [x] Events appear with different formatting when the event has passed (ex. negative time, indication the event has passed, crossed out, etc.).

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Filter events by day
- [x] Event cards show title persistently with details revealed on hover

## Notes

Took some effort to come up with a concept and generate the events themselves, as well as to get my .env file right and in the right place and imported correctly. I kept getting errors that weren't about .env but about connecting badly which took a while to figure out what it meant because it just showed up as "doesn't take SSL" but actually because .env wasn't correct it was trying to load from my local postgres, and then it did require SSL. Played with button position a lot on the home but in future I'd remap the buttons to the SVG polygons themselves.
